# Platitudes
#
Most of us do not know what to say that may 'help' those in grief.
Many of us do not know how to handle other people's pain.
Many well intentioned people use platitudes because they just don't know what to say.
Many people use platitudes due to their own fears (death, illness or the current trauma).
Platitudes help distance the speaker from the griever's situation (they acknowledge the condition but cannot face placing themselves in the other's current situation).
The speaker has no way of understanding the pain due to a lack in their own world view.
Perhaps those words are the best empathy a person can express in an uncomfortable time.
It's best to avoid platitudes. They do more harm than good. Plus, they're thoughtless.
It's best to avoid platitudes like there is a reason for everything.
No one wants to hear platitudes like Be Strong
Don't say platitudes like She did what she came here to do and it was her time to go.
You should avoid platitudes like She was so good, God wanted her with Him.
It's rude to say platitudes like You can still have another child.
It's best to avoid platitudes like Aren't you over him yet, he has been dead for a while now.
It's best to avoid platitudes like She brought this on yourself. I heard that often with my mom who smoked and died of lung cancer.
It's best to avoid platitudes like At least she lived a long life, many people die young.
At least he or she is out of pain.
It was God's will.
I know how you feel.
Everything will be okay.
Time heals all wounds.
It is time to put this behind you.
It's dumb and you do it anyway.

# Law
#
Burial laws in the United States vary significantly by state, affecting where, how, and under what conditions you can bury a loved one. 
These differences can have important implications for families planning funerals, burials on private land, or eco-friendly interments. 
Understanding your state’s regulations is essential to ensure legal compliance and avoid potential complications.
In many states, private land burials are legal but subject to specific zoning and environmental restrictions.
If private land burials are allowed, families should clearly mark the burial site and file records with the county to avoid legal issues during property sales.
Most states regulate cemeteries to ensure safety, record-keeping, and maintenance standards.
Natural or green burial cemeteries are becoming more common, but their operations are heavily regulated in states like New York and Washington.
While most states do not legally require a casket, individual cemeteries often have their own rules.
Some states, like Illinois, require burial vaults or grave liners to prevent ground collapse, while others leave it up to cemetery policy.
States like Oregon and Colorado are more permissive of biodegradable shrouds and natural containers, supporting eco-friendly burial practices.
For families interested in burying loved ones on their own property, home burials are legal in some states with conditions.

# Consolations
#
I'm sorry for your loss.
My condolences.
I'm here for you.
Words seem so feeble in moments like these.
Life is so precious, and death such a thief.
The depths of your pain I cannot comprehend, but I'll stand alongside you in the darkness, my friend.
My friend, I care.

# Grief
#
Grief is not an event. It is a process that does not end.
There is no end to grief. it is a labor we carry with us.
Working through death and loss takes work, not time. We must work to heal wounds. We must welcome our grief when we are able to sit with it.
Life is not comparative. It doesn't matter what loss we have experienced when we're helping other's process.
I am perhaps so full of grief that it leaks through the walls when the plaster dries.
So full of grief that the maintainers must be well fed at all times.
So full of grief the damn waits, ready to flood the artificial landscape below.
Grief is a part of life, and we will all know what it is to mourn at some point in our lives.
The Grieved are many, I am told, There is the various Cause. Death is but one and comes but once, And only nails the eyes.
A piercing Comfort it affords In passing Calvary.
How I suffered, dying a little each day until I got that fateful call.
So I'm still new at this, desperately trying to make sense of my life and her life now that she's gone.
grief suits me just fine in that it doesn't discriminate against me.
O' grief that which at times afflicts my very soul with sharp wounding sorrow.
How much more can my weary heart bear?
My life will never be the same.
Can't they just accept that I am grieving, let me mourn in peace and quit saying such hurtful things to me?
Back in 2004, I lost my girlfriend in a car accident.
I was shocked, devastated, and confused for many months.
I was 22 at the time and I never thought something like that could happen to me.
Before that, I was the confident guy, succeeding at most things I started.
Then, suddenly, my life was filled with darkness and my family and friends couldn't recognize me.
I tried hard to get out of that hole but apparently, I wasn't able.
That event changed me over the years and today.
It transformed me into who I am today, more humble and more grounded.
That being said, I wish you one thing: to spend quality time with people who are still in your life.
It is so heavy to carry.
This pathway through life Feels unbearable at times.
Forgive me if I cry, but there is nothing else to do.
Deep sadness overcame me When I heard the dreadful news.

# Poetry
#
The rythmic range of words fills me with horror.
When i wake up it's dark: still.
The earth which rubs against us.
I looked at you. the dark. the black. the black pitched round the quick point. of your belly.
Memory infinitely torturous.
Always, in memory, the colors get lost. here you are light or dark. It's all my language can muster.
Inside, you hedge me with photos.
your body thus. Drawing all light into my eyes.
The universe remains unreceptive to my offer of a proposition.
The proposition, 'you are dead', however, needs no universe of discourse.
This morning it's unthinkable to go out into the sun.
I cannot speak of nothing. Without this nothing. Turning on me. Reflecting nothing but myself.
A mouth coming undone starts at the lips.
I had begun to speak in poems, twenty two years before. After another death.
Before that other death I hadn't known how to speak at all.
I go on doing so, day after day, less from habit than refusing the death of a habit that's no longer important at all.
I really can face your picture, your likeness as it used to be called. It's difficult, but I can.
You have to force yourself to visit a grave. cypresses would have been a relief. From whar?
Your death goes on completing, fulfilling itself.
Not just your death. Dead you are. There's no denying it. and how? no use.
But inside me your death proceedS, slowly, incomprehesibly.
As if death had but frozen your fingertips, had but thrown a blanket of silence over us, had stopped at some door.
push back the earth.
scoop out the earth.
disinvent the dark.
In this tree. In this tree.
Write, write yourself alive in this tree.
Your face always the breath gone out of it as at the unfathomed moment when i understood.
Skin grey suddenly then drunk with oxygen.
far from me lost your footing in the unbreathable blood and pulled the sheet up over your hair.
say it i am going to die say it. Die so i won't know any more. say it.
hold my hand push back the night a little.
I have recognized your death. I've seen it.
So much absence.
I don't know what God is. I don't know what death is. But I believe they have between them some fervent and necessary arrangement.
Death waits for me, I know it, around one corner or another. This doesn't amuse me. Neither does it frighten me.
No man is an island, entire of itself.
Each man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.
I measure every Grief I meet With narrow, probing, eyes. I wonder if It weighs like Mine, Or has an Easier size.
I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled Is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave. Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind.
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.
there is only the sudden horror, the wrench of being torn apart; of being reminded that nothing is permanent, not even the ones we love, the ones our lives revolve around.
One by one, we lose those we love most into the dark ravine.
a great pit in our hearts; a pit we struggle to avoid during the day and fall into at night.
And some survive the shock, the denial, the horror, the bargaining, the barren, empty aching, the unanswered prayers, the sleepless nights when their breath is crushed under the weight of silence and all that it means.
slowly begin to remember the one lost in a different way.
We will still cry. We will always cry. But with loving reflection more than hopeless longing. That is how we survive.
Grief is a Mouse. And chooses Wainscot in the Breast For His Shy House, And baffles quest.
Grief is a Thief quick startled. Pricks His Ear report to hear Of that Vast Dark That swept His Being, back.
Best Grief is Tongueless, before He'll tell. Burn Him in the Public Square. His Ashes will, Possibly. if they refuse, How then know, Since a Rack couldn't coax a syllable — now
Time does not bring relief; you all have lied.
I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide;
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide. There are a hundred places where I fear To go, so with his memory they brim.
Silence the pianos and, with muffled drum, Bring out the coffin. Let the mourners come.
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling in the sky the message: He is dead!
Put crepe bows around the white necks of the public doves. Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
He was my north, my south, my east and west, My working week and Sunday rest, 
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song. I thought that love would last forever; I was wrong.
Though my mother was already two years dead, Dad kept her slippers warming by the gas, put hot water bottles her side of the bed and still went to renew her transport pass.
You couldn't just drop in. You had to phone. He'd put you off an hour to give him time to clear away her things and look alone, as though his still raw love were such a crime.
He couldn't risk my blight of disbelief though sure that very soon he'd hear her key scrape in the rusted lock and end his grief.
I believe life ends with death, and that is all. You haven't both gone shopping; just the same, in my new black leather phone book there's your name and the disconnected number I still call.
After the first death, there is no other.
And death shall have no dominion. Dead men naked they shall be one With the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone.
And death shall have no dominion. Under the windings of the sea They lying long shall not die windily.
And death shall have no dominion. No more may gulls cry at their ears Or waves break loud on the seashores.
Where blew a flower may a flower no more Lift its head to the blows of the rain; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down, And death shall have no dominion.
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright. Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight. Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf, So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.
The day is ending, The night is descending; The marsh is frozen, The river dead.
Do not stand By my grave, and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there; I did not die.
When great trees fall in forests, small things recoil into silence, their senses eroded beyond fear.
When great souls die, the air around us becomes light, rare, sterile. We breathe, briefly. Our eyes, briefly, see with a hurtful clarity.
Our memory, suddenly sharpened, examines, gnaws on kind words unsaid, promised walks never taken.
And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly. Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration.
Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be. Be and be better. For they existed.
Your body is away from me but there is a window open from my heart to yours. From this window, like the moon I keep sending news secretly.
If flowers grow in heaven, pick a rose for me.
death can take that away.
death can't take that away.
By the shore of sorrow's sea, waves of tears roll endlessly.
Somewhere a million fingernails dug exquisitely scratching at a thousand histerically screeching blackboards.
Then, someone at my side says, 'There, she is gone.'
Gone where?
Gone from my sight. That is all.
Your picture is still hanging on my wall.
I dreamed that one had died in a strange place.
And they had nailed the boards above her face.
The peasants of that land, Wondering to lay her in that solitude.
Raised above her mound A cross they had made out of two bits of wood.
And I left her to the indifferent stars above.
She was more beautiful than thy first love, But now lies under boards.
Subtle Sounds of death resound, and lyres smote as children drowned.
Leave the guilded room to lie alone benighted in the tomb, god only is immortal, man not so. Life, to be paid upond demand we owe.

# Lyrics from what we do in the shadows
#
Don't sing if you want to live long. They have no use for your song.
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. You're dead and out of this world.
You'll never get a second chance. Plan all your moves in advance.
Stay dead, stay dead, stay dead. Stay dead and out of this world.
Run fast, don't stand in the sun. There's too much work to be done.
You're down, you're down, you're down. You're down and out of this world.
Don't ever talk with your eyes. Be sure that you compromise.
Hear the unloved weeping like rain. Guard your sleep from the sound of their pain.
Long gone, long gone, long gone. Long gone and out of this world.
When you smile and it tears your face. It's time for the inhuman race.
Now, your hope and compassion is gone. You've sold out your dream to the world.
#
# Mount Erie Lyrics
#
You were probably aching, wanting not to die. Your body transformed. I couldn't bear to look so I turned my head.
Here, where I sit the next October, still seeing your eyes, pleading and afraid.
I watched you die in this room, then I gave your clothes away. I'm sorry, I had to.
We will ride over water With your ghost underneath the boat. What was you is now burnt bones and I cannot be at home.
You had cancer and you were killed and I'm left living like this, crying on the logging roads with your ashes in a jar.
Thinking about the things I'll tell you When you get back from wherever it is that you've gone.
But then I remember death is real and I'm still here.
You've been dead for one month and three days, and we are sleeping in the forest.
Nothing dies here. But here is where I came to grieve, to dive into it with you, with your absence.

# Tuesday's with Morrie
#
He was weary all the time. He had trouble sleeping. He dreamt he was dying.
Yes, you are going to die, the doctor said. I'm very sorry.
How much time do we have left? How will we manage? How will we pay the bills?
Don't they know what has happened to me?
Why suffer in front of so many people? Stay at home. But the idea of quitting did not occur to him.
The man frozen inside his own flesh. This takes no more than five years.
make death your final project, the center point of your last days. 
What a waste, he said. All those people saying all those wonderful things, and he never got to hear any of it.
You can have a living funeral.
It was the most helpless I have ever felt in my life.
I told him not to talk that way. He stared at me sadly.
He wrote bite-sized philosophies about living with death's shadow.
There are some mornings when I cry and cry and mourn for myself. Some mornings, I'm so angry and bitter. But it doesn't last too long. 
What do you dread the most about this slow, insidious decay?
My tank is almost empty.
I did not know the study of human relations could be considered scholarly.
Love wins. Love always wins.
Love is the only rational act.
I envied the quality of her time even as I lamented its diminishing supply.
So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy on things they call important.
why are we embarrassed by silence?
I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on all the good things still in my life. 
I felt the seeds of death inside his shriveling frame.
I had the coldest realization that our time was running out.
If you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them. Even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling.
I'm going to die. And sooner, not later.
Tapes, like photographs and videos, are a desperate attempt to steal something from death.
That was seventy years ago my mother died. The pain still goes on.
What will you do without your mother? What will become of you?
I watched as they shoveled dirt into his mother's grave.
How else can a child confront death?
Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it.
Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?
Is today the day I die?
his final months on earth seemed to transcend all religious differences. 
Death has a way of doing that.
Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
facing death changes all that.
When you realize you are going to die, you see everything much differently.
The things you spend so much time on – all this work you do – might not be as important. 
make room for some more spiritual things.
tried to see what he saw. I tried to see time and seasons, my life passing in slow motion.
I hope you can find the healing power in grieving.
his skin pale. The disease owns him.
Love each other or perish.
The same type of cancer as my uncle. The pancreas. A rare form.
His hair fell out, his face went gaunt as a skeleton. It's supposed to be me, I thought.
he held us at bay, insisting this fight was something he needed to do by himself.
united by childish pride. That wasn't so hard, we think, and we are ready to take on death again.
I just wanted to help in some way.
Detaching myself. And this is important–not just for someone like me, who is dying, but for someone like you, who is perfectly healthy. Learn to detach.
You know what the Buddhists say? Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent.
Aren't you always talking about experiencing life? how can you do that if you're detached?
Detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully.
you're too busy being afraid. You're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief. You're afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. 
I know you think this is just about dying.
All right, it's just fear, I don't have to let it control me. I see it for what it is.
I know how I want to die.
I don't want to leave the world in a state of fright. I want to know what's happening, accept it, get to a peaceful place, and let go. Do you understand?
No. Not yet. We still have work to do. 
There is a tribe in the North American Arctic, for example, who believe that all things on earth have a soul that exists in a miniature form of the body that holds it–so that a deer has a tiny deer inside it, and a man has a tiny man inside him.
When the large being dies, that tiny form lives on. It can slide into something being born nearby, or it can go to a temporary resting place in the sky, in the belly of a great feminine spirit, where it waits until the moon can send it back to earth.
Sometimes, they say, the moon is so busy with the new souls of the world that it disappears from the sky. That is why we have moonless nights.
I had gone from being proud to say my age–because of all I had done so young–to not bringing it up, for fear I was getting too close to forty and, therefore, oblivion.
All these kids who came to me with their struggles, their strife, their feelings of inadequacy, their sense that life was miserable, so bad they wanted to kill themselves.
Aging is not just decay, you know. It's growth. It's more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.
if you've found meaning in your life, you don't want to go back. You want to go forward. You want to see more, do more.
If you're always battling against getting older, you're always going to be unhappy, because it will happen anyhow.
The fact is, you are going to die eventually.
It won't matter what you tell yourself.
You have to find what's good and true and beautiful in your life as it is now.
I Don't Want My Tombstone To Read...
We put our values in the wrong things. And it leads to very disillusioned lives. 
I think we should talk about that.
Now, more than ever, material things held little or no significance.
I can tell you, as I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for.
Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.
I'm dying, right?
Do the kinds of things that come from the heart. When you do, you won't be dissatisfied.
he couldn't think of anything else for his tombstone?
Smashing the windshield of a passing car, killing a teenage girl who was traveling with her family on a religious pilgrimage. 
The being sick itself was sinking him.
When you're in bed, you're dead.
Dying man talks to living man, tells him what he should know.
I worried about being forgotten after I died.
Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone.
Do you ever hear my voice sometimes when you're back home? When you're all alone? Maybe on the plane? Maybe in your car?
And if you want to cry a little, it's okay.
I decided what I wanted on my tombstone.
I am talking to you. I am thinking about you.
The last time I saw my own father was in a city morgue.
I was called to identify the body. I was taken downstairs, to the cold room where the corpses were kept.
The horror of the room, he would later say, sucked all other functions out of him. He did not cry until days later.
There is a tribe called the Desana, who see the world as a fixed quantity of energy that flows between all creatures.
Every birth must therefore engender a death, and every death bring forth another birth. This way, the energy of the world remains complete.
The closer he gets to good-bye, the more he seems to feel we are all creatures in the same forest. 
What we take, we must replenish.
I shuddered when I thought how close death was.
This was a foolish hope.
He was taking food through a straw. 
We all laughed, a nervous laughter that comes when the devil is within earshot.
It would have been cute, this little scene, were it not what we all knew it was, the final calisthenics before death.
Sometimes he would close his eyes and try to draw the air up into his mouth and nostrils, and it seemed as if he were trying to lift an anchor.
in the end, nature takes it away from us anyhow.
in between, we need others as well.
If I can't say something, will you say it for me.
he was letting go of some of the outside world, instead listening more to music and watching the leaves change color through his window.
Living means I can be responsive to the other person. It means I can show my emotions and my feelings. Talk to them. Feel with them.
Don't let go too soon, but don't hang on too long.
he wanted to die with serenity.
as his body rotted, his character shone even more brightly.
This disease is knocking at my spirit. But it will not get my spirit. It'll get my body. It will not get my spirit.
Do I get to be one of the angels?
Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others.
these things I so regret in my life. Pride. Vanity. Why do we do the things we do?
those movies where the patriarch of the family is on his death bed and he calls for his estranged son so that he can make peace.
The sudden need to say “I'm sorry” before dying.
I feel so sad. I never got to see him. I never got to forgive.
Tears are okay.
Make peace. You need to make peace with yourself and everyone around you.
I mourn my dwindling time, but I cherish the chance it gives me to make things right.
I've picked a place to be buried.
I'm planning on being dead there.
You'll come to my grave? To tell me your problems?
After I'm dead, you talk. And I'll listen.
We are so afraid of the sight of death.
As soon as someone dies in a hospital, they pull the sheets up over their head, and they wheel the body to some chute and push it down.
They can't wait to get it out of their sight. People act as if death is contagious.
It's not contagious, you know. Death is as natural as life. It's part of the deal we made.
The nurses would come into the bedroom, pound him on the back, try to bring up the poison.
The oxygen tube was up his nose now. I hated the sight of it.
To me, it symbolized helplessness.
I felt a certain peace, I felt that I was ready to go.
It was a most incredible feeling. The sensation of accepting what was happening, being at peace. 
If we know, in the end, that we can ultimately have that peace with dying, then we can finally make peace with living.
As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. 
Death ends a life, not a relationship.
He was too far gone.
I tried to imagine her healthy.
I know it hurts when you can't be with someone you love.
I tell everyone I know to carry on with the life they know – don't ruin it because I am dying.
I looked at him. I saw all the death in the world. I felt helpless.
You've had these special times with your brother, and you no longer have what you had with him. You want them back. You never want them to stop. But that's part of being human.
My God, this is terrible!
Look what's going to happen to me!
all of us are going to be nothing! Isn't it terrible?
He had been sleeping much of the time, which was unlike him.
I don't like to think about it.
This is such a shame.
I helped her straighten up, noticing all the bottles of pills.
Sometimes, when you're losing someone, you hang on to whatever tradition you can.
His skin was pale and tight against his cheekbones.
he tried to speak, but I heard only a soft grunt.
I pulled the covers down and grasped his fingers. They disappeared inside my own. 
I don't know how to say good-bye.
he wanted no chilling moments, no one to witness his last breath and be haunted by it, the way he had been haunted by his mother's death.
He wanted to go serenely, and that is how he went.
The funeral was held on a damp, windy morning.
We stood by the hole in the earth.
I glanced around the cemetery. It was indeed a lovely spot.
None of us can undo what we've done, or relive a life already recorded.
There is no such thing as too late in life.
I don't want to lose you. I love you.

# Advice
#
Quiet and sincere sympathy is often the most welcome and efficient consolation to the afflicted.
Even if you don't know what to say, the fact that you are there does provide some comfort.
Offer a hug and a shoulder to cry on.
It's not easy, that's why it's needed.
Acknowledge the loss in an honest way.
Speak directly. Don't use euphemisms like passed on.
Don't cry as it will upset your mother.
Grief is about a broken heart, yet often we speak to people's intellect as opposed to their heart.
There will be a time for you to share, but not right now. Your role is to listen and stay with the person's loss.
As adults, we often mistakenly believe we can protect children by withholding information from them.
Share fond memories of the deceased. Do not make a name taboo. The bereaved need very much to talk it out and they may love to hear stories of their lost one. 
Be patient IF they retell the same story over-and-over. Story-telling is part of the healing process.
Bereavement can make us feel helpless and awkward. It's okay to be honest about it.
You can not fix things, so don't offer advice.
Be a good listener.
For some it will take months to separate from the physical body. For others, only minutes.
Death is as uniques as the person experiencing it.
The actual dying process often begins within the two weeks prior to death.
There is a shift in a person that takes them to a true comprehension and belief in their own mortality.
embrace the significance of this inevitable transition with courage and grace.
By comprehending the stages and signs of the end-of-life process, caregivers can alleviate some of the fear and uncertainty that often accompany this time.
A time of withdrawl, inside there is sorting out, evaluating one's life. 
But inside there is only room for one.
Processing one's life is usually done with eyes closed so sleep increases.
Spending more time asleep than awake becomes the norm.
Words lose their importance. Words are part of the physical life that is being left behind.
Touch takes on more meaning.
Appetite diminishes significantly, and eventually, eating and drinking cease altogether.
This is a normal part of the dying process, as the body no longer requires the sustenance it once did.
It can be distressing to witness, but it's a typical sign.
The dying person might also experience changes in circulation, leading to coolness and discoloration of the skin.
It's important for caregivers to remain calm and patient during these times, offering reassurance and gentle presence.
In the final days and hours of life, awareness often decreases further. Coma-like states become common, and the dying person might slip in and out of consciousness.
At this stage, many caregivers struggle with feelings of helplessness.
Breathing patterns can alter significantly; this is commonly known as Cheyne-Stokes respiration, characterized by periods of rapid breathing followed by pauses.
remember that providing a peaceful and comforting environment can be one of the best ways to support a loved one.
Caregivers should seek the guidance of healthcare professionals to manage pain and other symptoms effectively.
offer appropriate care while respecting the dying person's journey.
contribute to a more peaceful and dignified passing.
The emotional and psychological journey of letting go is a deeply personal and multifaceted experience for those who are facing the end of their life.
This withdrawal is a natural part of the process and can manifest in various forms, such as a decreased interest in activities that once brought joy, a desire for solitude, and a diminished engagement with loved ones.
often mistaken for depression, these changes reflect the dying person's need to conserve energy and focus on their internal experience.
These altered states of consciousness can include vivid dreams, hallucinations, or moments of clarity and lucidity.
Many dying people experience periods of confusion or disorientation as their mind begins to let go of the physical world.
Offering emotional support to a dying person requires sensitivity and empathy. 
Listening without judgment and allowing them to express their feelings and fears is crucial.
Recognizing the common physical changes and symptoms that occur as death approaches can help caregivers remain calm and focused.
Emotional support is crucial.
suggest simple yet meaningful gestures such as reading to the loved one, playing their favorite music, or sharing stories and memories.
Maintaining self-care is pivotal for caregivers, who often face immense stress and emotional strain.
a routine that includes regular breaks, nutritious meals, and some form of relaxation, like meditation or a walk, can be greatly beneficial.
The act of caregiving should not come at the expense of the caregiver's own health and wellbeing.
Equally important is the acknowledgment that caregivers cannot do it all alone.
Professional assistance from hospice care providers can offer specialized knowledge and alleviate some of the caregiving burdens.
Hospice teams often provide not only medical care but also emotional and spiritual support, giving caregivers much-needed respite and guidance.
be there for someone at their most vulnerable, offering not just care but companionship and love.
Soft lighting, soothing music, and minimizing loud and sudden noises can establish a serene atmosphere.
Familiar and cherished belongings, such as photographs, favorite blankets, or personal mementos, can provide comfort and a sense of home.
It is crucial to engage in conversations about their beliefs, values, and any unresolved issues they might wish to address, helping them find peace and closure.
Open and honest discussions about their preferences for their care and environment can help ensure their dignity is maintained.
Empowering the dying to make these choices, acknowledges their autonomy and respects their desires during this profound time.
the presence of family and friends can be comforting only if it aligns with the wishes of the dying person.
Limiting the number of visitors and scheduling visits can help balance the need for connection with the need for rest and privacy.
When a loved one passes away, the initial moments and hours can be overwhelming, filled with a blend of grief and the need to take immediate, necessary actions.
One of the first actions after a death occurs is to notify the appropriate authorities.
officially pronounce the death, a necessary step before taking further action.
Once the death has been legally pronounced, the next steps involve contacting a funeral home or mortuary.
The funeral home will handle transporting the body, preparing necessary documents, and guiding you through further arrangements.
Legal and logistical arrangements can feel daunting but are crucial to handle promptly. Begin by securing important documents such as the death certificate.
contemplate death not as an ending but as a natural transition — an intrinsic part of the human journey that is both daunting and deeply meaningful.
Understanding the natural process of dying can radically alter our perception of death.
She emphasizes that when we accept death as a part of life, we can provide more compassionate care and find solace in the experience.
shift their focus from the fear of loss to the opportunity for connection.
find personal meaning and acceptance in the face of loss.
the process of dying can be a profoundly spiritual journey, not only for the person who is passing but also for their loved ones.
engage in open conversations about death, share fears, and explore beliefs about mortality.
By facing these topics head-on, we can demystify death and approach it with a sense of calm and prepared acceptance.
extend kindness not only to the dying but also to yourself as you navigate emotions and experiences.
finding meaning in the journey of life and death is an essential part of the human experience.
Although you might feel relief at not having to deal with the situation, your friend will know that you didn't acknowledge their great loss. 
They may feel hurt or abandoned, just because you were afraid of saying the wrong thing.
The five stages, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost.
The five stages are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. 
But the stages are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of them or in a prescribed order.
Denial is the first of the five stages of grief.
Denial helps us to survive the loss. In this stage, the world becomes meaningless and overwhelming. Life makes no sense.
We go numb. We wonder how we can go on, if we can go on, why we should go on.
Denial helps us to pace our feelings of grief. There is a grace in denial. It is nature's way of letting in only as much as we can handle.
As you accept the reality of the loss and start to ask yourself questions, you are unknowingly beginning the healing process.
As you proceed, all the feelings you were denying begin to surface.
Anger is a necessary stage of the healing process.
Be willing to feel your anger, even though it may seem endless. The more you truly feel it, the more it will begin to dissipate and the more you will heal.
There are many other emotions under the anger and you will get to them in time.
The truth is that anger has no limits. It can extend not only to your friends, the doctors, your family, yourself and your loved one who died, but also to God.
Underneath anger is pain, your pain.
It is natural to feel deserted and abandoned.
Anger is strength and it can be an anchor, giving temporary structure to the nothingness of loss.
Grief feels like being lost at sea.
The anger becomes a bridge over the open sea. It is something to hold onto.
Before a loss, it seems like you will do anything if only your loved one would be spared.
Guilt is often bargaining's companion. The 'if onlys' cause us to find fault in ourselves and what we think we could have done differently.
Would you do anything not to feel the pain of this loss?
The stages are responses to feelings that can last for minutes or hours as we flip in and out of one and then another.
We remain in the past, trying to negotiate our way out of the hurt.
Empty feelings present themselves, and grief enters our lives on a deeper level, deeper than we ever imagined.
This depressive stage feels as though it will last forever.
Depression is the appropriate response to a great loss.
We withdraw from life, left in a fog of intense sadness, wondering, perhaps, if there is any point in going on.
Depression after a loss is too often seen as unnatural.
The first question to ask yourself is whether or not the situation you're in is actually depressing. The loss of a loved one is a very depressing situation.
Depression is a normal and appropriate response.
When a loss fully settles in your soul, the realization that your loved one didn't get better this time and is not coming back is understandably depressing.
Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being all right or ok with what has happened. This is not the case.
Most people don't ever feel OK or all right about the loss of a loved one.
Acceptance is about accepting the reality that our loved one is physically gone and recognizing that this new reality is the permanent reality.
We will never like this reality or make it OK, but eventually we accept it. We learn to live with it.
In time, through bits and pieces of acceptance, however, we see that we cannot maintain the past intact. It has been forever changed and we must readjust.
Finding acceptance may be just having more good days than bad ones.
As we begin to live again and enjoy our life, we often feel that in doing so, we are betraying our loved one.
Instead of denying our feelings, listen to your needs. we move, we change, we grow, we evolve.
We begin to live again, but we cannot do so until we have given grief its time.
Children and teens need and want the truth as much as adults do.
Do Not Present Information about a death over the Public Address, P.A., system. It is impersonal.
After a death, especially a violent death, people may be wondering how to stay safe and to take care of themselves.
Each person approaches death in their own way, bringing to this last experience their uniqueness.
There are many roads arriving at the same destination.

She saw herself dead. the bundle of neurons changed.
Dead was dead. utter. incomprehensible.
Dead was nowhere.
Dead wasn't coffins, mourners, crematories. Dead was an intolerable nowhere.

There is no deeper narrative that makes sense of it all, much as we'd like to believe there is. It's all just chance and happenstance.
We live in a society that fears anger.
Death gives value to life.
Death is hard, but part of life. We can only accept.
The question is not 'How long did you live?'. The question is 'Did you give?'.
We can't forget someone so we don't truly lose them.
What's the most important lesson when you lose someone?
Grievers often feel abandoned by friends in the midst of their loss.
So often as well meaning friends, co-workers and loved ones , we don't know what to say to a person who has just experienced a loss so we say nothing at all.
Often teens not only deal with the loss of a parent, but also have to take on many more responsibilities around the house which often leads to feelings of resentment on top of their raw grief.
While we know nothing for certain about what happens before we are born or after we die, death marks an unavoidable destination in the path of every human being.
Death can be a relieving certainty or a looming threat.
Many philosophers have written extensive works on the matter. Some of these perspectives are essential for understanding the intellectual development of western civilization.
Concerning the philosophy of death, first, we discuss what it is to be alive.
#Socrates
The immortality of the soul is a very important point of Socratic philosophy as a whole and the core aspect of his views on death itself.
In nature we can clearly observe that life emerges from death and decay – and so must the soul, which survives our physical death and eventually returns as a new life.
According to Socrates, immortality can be proved by arguments resting on the existence of the cycle of life.
Socrates insists that while our lives are to be cherished as gifts of the gods death is not an evil thing that we should fear.
If you live your life as a moral person your soul should be in balance, and death is simply the natural way to free your soul and guide it to the eternal truths.
Death is seen as the liberation of the soul and that is why it should be faced with serenity.
The Socratic perspective on death is a beautiful way of viewing the end of our lives.
#Decartes
Ever since Ancient times it was understood that body and soul consisted in two parts of the same entity.
Descartes claimed that the body and the soul were separate entities that merely interacted with each other. The immortal soul persists as consciousness after the end.
The immortal soul persists as consciousness after the end of our physiological functions, because existence after death wouldn't make sense without a mind to verify such existence.
The established conception up until that point was that death consisted in the decay of the physical body and the departure of the soul.
How can the very moment of disconnection between the body and the soul be determined?
#Kierkegaard
One's view of death is intrinsically linked to one's view of life and existence as a whole.
Death is an uncertain certainty.
It is that uncertain certainty of death and how we feel about it that leads us to choose how we live our lives, whether to experience as much pleasure as we can, seek something that transcends our mortality, or even try to make the world a better place.
Our paths are guided by our knowledge of the impending end of our lives, and we must make our choices before we meet that end.
Kierkegaard's thoughts on death are a very pragmatic approach that givea a lot of importance to how we as humans feel about our own mortality.
#Schopenhauer
We constantly want things and therefore are doomed.
The will is necessarily a will to live, meaning that we want things that can be experienced by us in our lives.
Schopenhauer claims that death is the aim and ultimate purpose of life, for only in death are we free from the constant cycle of suffering in life.
A person who wishes to commit suicide does not really want to end their life, what they really want is to experience things in life that they don't have access to in that moment.
The denial of the will is to overcome your desires, not to be defeated by the suffering that they bring.
One may also understand life as a process of constant dying.
As time passes and the present becomes the past, present desires pass away and eventually no longer exist, like small samples of death that are experienced as time goes by.
Schopenhauer is a pessimist.
The work of Schopenhauer, while pessimistic in nature, provides us with some ironically uplifting perspectives.
It is somewhat relieving to know that our ultimate certainty in life is that the suffering will end.
#Nietzsche
According to Nietzsche, our purpose as humans should be to achieve a state of total freedom that allows us to define our own values, principles, and objectives in life.
We may also have the freedom to define our own death. Death should be neither impending doom nor final release, but an act of free will.
A person who has achieved their freedom must be able to claim death for themselves.
The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche when it comes to death brings up a lot of controversy.
Nietzsche insists that we should live a fulfilling life according to our own view of the world, and that death shouldn't be forced upon us.
We have the power to conquer death and make it a part of our success in life.
#plato.stanford.edu/entries/death/
Vitalism is a nonstarter since it is unclear what sort of stuff vitalists take life to be, and because no likely candidates — no special stuff found in all and only living things — have been detected.
Sometimes when we speak of a life we mean to refer to the events that make up something's history — the things that it did and the things that happened to it.
We want clarification of what it is to be alive.
If lives are biological events, it would be useful to know more about what they are, how they are individuated, and what their persistence conditions are.
Life-functionalism, a view introduced by Aristotle, analyzes the property alive in terms of one or more salient functions that living things typically are able to perform.
We might adopt NASA's definition, according to which life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.
Feldman concludes that life is a mystery.
A live object has a distinctive sort of control over whether things come to be, or cease to be, part of it.
The event by which the capacity to engage in vital activities is lost is one thing, and the state of affairs of its having been lost it is another.
In some cases dying is especially complicated, because the self-modifying activities of some organisms result in the construction of complex physiological systems that must remain largely intact for the self-modifying activities of these organisms to remain integrated.
In defining death, some theorists focus on systems, and claim that an organism's life ends when that organism's physiological systems can no longer function as an integrated whole.
They are not dead, but are they alive?
When we say that something is dead, we mean to emphasize that a capacity has been lost.
People often speak of being dead as a ‘state' or ‘condition' as opposed to an event or process.
Some theorists deny that an object that is at one time an organism may continue its existence as a corpse. Such theorists will say that organisms and their corpses are two different objects.
Imagine a futuristic device that chops me into small cubes, or individual cells, or disconnected atoms, which it stores and later reassembles just as they were. It is far from obvious that I would survive.
I would not live during intervals when my atoms are stacked in storage. I would not even exist during such intervals.
Restoration, not revival, is a way of bringing a creature back from the dead.
Dying is the loss of an object's life—the loss of its capacity to perpetuate itself using vital activities. An object dies at the time it loses this capacity. It is dead at all times afterwards, except while that capacity is regained.
If we are animals, with the persistence conditions of animals, we die when we cease to be the same animal.
If we are minds, with the persistence conditions for minds, we die when we cease to meet these conditions.
If persistence is determined by our retaining certain psychological features, then the loss of those features will constitute death.
The mind could survive the extinction of the human animal.
The term termination refers to the view that when a person dies, he or she … goes out of existence; subsequently, there is no such thing as that person.
Even in morgues calling something a dead person does not imply that it is a person.
Can creatures cease to exist without dying? Certainly things that never were alive, such as bubbles and statues, can be deathlessly annihilated.
If people could divide like amoebas, perhaps they, too could cease to exist without dying.
Nothing can be alive unless it exists, so if something ceases to exist it ceases to be alive, but to cease to be alive is to die. So there are no deathless exits.
Defining death is one thing; providing criteria by which it can be readily detected or verified is another.
Some adopted criteria for the death of a person modeled on the Uniform Determination of Death Act.
A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.
Animalists might resist the criteria since the vital activities of human beings whose entire brains have ceased to function can be sustained artificially using cardiopulmonary assistance. 
Mindists and personists might also resist the criteria, on the grounds that minds and all psychological features can be destroyed in human beings whose brain stems are intact.
Is death bad for some people who die? Is it good for some of them?
The better life is, we think, the better more life would be, and the worse death is. At this point, we are in danger of condemning the human condition, which embraces life and death.
Life has a tragic side, namely death.
It is no wonder that theorists over the millennia have sought to defeat the harm thesis.
When we are, death is not, and when death is present, then we are not.
Death is to be deprived of sensation.
Make yourself familiar with the belief that death is nothing to us, since everything good and bad lies in sensation.
If a person's death is not an experience at all, clearly it is not an experience that is intrinsically good or bad for her.
A person may experience dying, and the experience of dying might well be intrinsically bad.
The question arises as to whether, for some people, it is extrinsically bad to die.
Dying is wholly a matter of indifference for those who do not experience it, say because they sleep through it.
Suppose that I desire that my child have a happy upbringing, and it turns out that I am the only one who can make this happen, but I die suddenly, and as a consequence she has a miserable childhood.
Arguably, my untimely death would be bad for me, in that it would thwart my desire, even if I die in my sleep, and am never aware of her fate.
Comparativism might say that death is bad for us because of the goods it deprives us of, and not, or at least not always, because of any intrinsic evils for which it is responsible.
When, in particular, does dying painlessly make a person worse off?
But if this is the reason we cannot ascribe misfortune to a victim of death then we cannot even ascribe death to any victim.
You are your (joyless) corpse at time two.
Now, it does make sense to attribute the property lacks joy to a corpse, and to a person who has stopped existing.
The same seems true of us during such times as we are no longer alive — times when we have become corpses or when those corpses have turned to dust.
Death takes a person out of actual existence, the dead are not 'there' to be harmed.
Modal realism with the thesis of transworld identity says that although a dead person no longer exists in the actual world, one and the same person is still alive, and exists, in other possible worlds.
Even a period of time with blurry edges must occur before, after or at the same time as a mortem event.
If true at all, the proposition that death is overall bad for us simpliciter is an eternal, a timeless, truth.
#Thomas Nagel
If death is the unequivocal and permanent end of our existence, the question arises whether it is a bad thing to die.
Some people think death is dreadful; others have no objection to death per se, though they hope their own will be neither premature nor painful. 
Those in the former category tend to think those in the latter are blind to the obvious. 
while, the latter suppose the former to be prey to some sort of confusion. 
On the one hand it can be said that life is all we have and the loss of it is the greatest loss we can sustain. 
On the other hand it may be objected that death deprives this supposed loss of its subject, and that if we realize that death is not an unimaginable condition of the persisting person, but a mere blank, then it can have no value whatever.
I want to ask whether death is in itself an evil; and how great an evil, and of what kind, it might be.
The question should be of interest even to those who believe in some form of immortality, for one's attitude towards immortality must depend in part on one's attitude toward death.
If death is an evil at all, it cannot be because of its positive features, but only because of what it deprives us of.
These goods are widely regarded as formidable benefits in themselves, despite the fact that they are conditions of misery as well as of happiness.
It is good simply to be alive, even if one is undergoing terrible experiences.
Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.
Those inconveniences would not obliterate the basic advantage of continued, though discontinuous, existence.
If death is a disadvantage, it is not easy to say when a man suffers it.
The point that death is not regarded as an unfortunate state enables us to refute a curious but very common suggestion about the origin of the fear of death.
This imagining task is logically impossible, the conviction that death is mysterious and therefore a terrifying prospective state.
We must now turn to the serious difficulties which this hypothesis raises, difficulties about loss and privation in general.
It may be doubted that there are any evils which consist merely in the deprivation or absence of possible goods.
There are special difficulties, in the case of death.
Another difficulty concerns the asymmetry between our attitudes to posthumous and prenatal nonexistence. How can the former be bad if the latter is not?
It means that a man is not injured if his wishes are ignored by the executor of his will, or if, after his death, there is belief that all the literary works on which his fame rest were written by his brother, who died in Mexico at the age of 28.
It seems to me worth asking what assumptions about good and evil lead to these drastic restrictions.
What of the case of a man who wastes his life in the cheerful pursuit of a method of communicating with asparagus plants.
The intelligent adult has disappeared for a creature like the one before us.
We consider the person he was, and the person he could be now, a catastrophe.
They are features of the relations between a person, with spatial and temporal boundaries of the usual sort, and circumstances which may not coincide with him either in space or in time.
It is possible to regard time as just another type of distance.
death is an evil that must be accounted for, and the impossibility of locating it within life should not trouble us.
He has lost his life, and if he had not died, he would have continued to live it, and to possess whatever good there is in living.
One must be content just to state that his life is over and there will never be any more of it. That fact, rather than his past or present condition, constitutes his misfortune.
Nevertheless if there is a loss, someone must suffer it.
He observed that no one finds it disturbing to contemplate the eternity preceding his own birth, and he took this to show that it must be irrational to fear death.
Death is simply the mirror image of the prior abyss.
We know perfectly well what it would be for him to have had it instead of losing it, and there is no difficulty in identifying the loser.
I confess to being troubled by the above argument, on the ground that it is too sophisticated.
Although they will both be dead forever, Keats' death deprived him of many years of life which were allowed to Tolstoy.
The question is whether we can regard as a misfortune any limitations, like mortality, that is normal to the species.
The trouble is that life familiarizes us with the goods of which death deprives us.
The situation is an ambiguous one.
Observed from without, human beings obviously have a natural lifespan and cannot live much longer than a hundred years.
A man's sense of his own experience, on the other hand, does not embody this idea of a natural limit.
Having been gratuitously introduced to the world by a collection of natural, historical, and social accidents, he finds himself the subject of a life.
Viewed in this way, death, no matter how inevitable, is an abrupt cancellation of indefinitely extensive possible goods.
Suppose that we were all inevitably going to die in agony – physical agony lasting six months. Would inevitability make that prospect any less unpleasant?
If there is no limit to the amount of life that it would be good to have, then it may be that a bad end is in store for us all.

Life has more meaning in the face of death.
The meaning of life is that it stops.
The phoenix must burn to emerge.
Take nothing for granted. Keep in mind that it can come at anytime. Even today.
It's better to burn out than to fade away.
Every exit is an entry somewhere else.
I shall not die of a cold. I shall die of having lived.
The idea is to die young as late as possible.
It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.
Even trees do not die without a groan.
The highest tribute to the dead is not grief but gratitude.
Death is not extinguishing the light; it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.
If life must not be taken too seriously, then so neither must death.
Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
By becoming deeply aware of our mortality, we intensify our experience of every aspect of life.
Death and pain are windows to great insight if you have the strength to look through them.
I discovered to my joy, that it is life, not death, that has no limits.
Death? Be as proud as you want: bore me later, because Love is sovereign here. Life never ends. Joy comes in the morning. Glory hallelujah. And let it be so.
Whether or not there's an afterlife, screw it. Just live your life right here right now before it's too late.
Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough.
Let children walk with Nature, let them see the beautiful blendings and communions of death and life, their joyous inseparable unity, as taught in woods and meadows, plains and mountains and streams of our blessed star, and they will learn that death is stingless indeed, and as beautiful as life.
I would rather die a meaningful death than to live a meaningless life.
When we finally know we are dying, and all other sentient beings are dying with us, we start to have a burning, almost heartbreaking sense of the fragility and preciousness of each moment and each being, and from this can grow a deep, clear, limitless compassion for all beings.
Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive – the risk to be alive and express what we really are.
Losing is discovering, which is living.
There is only one god and his name is Death, and there is only one thing we say to Death: ‘Not today'.
Do not fear death. Death is always at our side. When we show fear, it jumps at us faster than light. But, if we do not show fear, it casts its eye upon us gently and then guides us into infinity.
Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace.
Here is the test to find whether your mission on Earth is finished: if you're alive, it isn't.
Death ends a life, not a relationship.
Death is beautiful when seen to be a law, and not an accident.
Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split and recombine. Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our nature.
We owe respect to the living; to the dead we owe only truth.
I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time.
For life be, after all, only a waitin‘ for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that we can rightly depend on.
Losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen. The worst thing is to lose your reason for living.
Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. 
But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is just a passing shadow of a cloud.
The harder the pain, the longer the path to recovery, the better the opportunity to learn.
To the most trivial actions, attach the devotion and mindfulness of a hundred monks. To matters of life and death, attach a sense of humor.
Die happily and look forward to taking up a new and better form. Like the sun, only when you set in the west can you rise in the east.
Life is for the living. Death is for the dead. Let life be like music. And death a note unsaid.
It is the fate — the genetic and neural fate — of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.
Man always thinks about the past before he dies, as if he were frantically searching for proof that he truly lived.
It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it's called Life.
Death comes to all, but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold.
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming 'Wow! What a Ride!'
Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.

# American Indian
In some tribes, death rituals include painting the faces of the dead red, the color of life.
In some tribes, the body of the deceased is washed with yucca.
feathers are tied around the head of the deceased as a form of prayer. 
Some families dress the deceased in full regalia and jewelry, with shoes for their trip to the next world.
Some Southwestern tribes, especially the Apache and Navajo, feared the ghosts of the deceased who were believed to resent the living.
The Apache buried corpses swiftly and burned the deceased's house and possessions.
The mourning family purified itself ritually and moved to a new place to escape their dead family member's ghost.
The Navajo also buried their dead quickly with little ceremony. Any Navajos exposed to a corpse had to undergo a long, ritual purification.
Navajos select family members to mourn. Mourners bathe and dress the body in special garments.
The mourners bury the deceased far away from the living areas, along with their possessions and the tools used to bury the body.
If the deceased died in their hogan —home of tree and bark— family members burn it along with any remaining possessions.
many tribes see the deceased as ever-present ancestral spirits who sometimes lend aid.
The Sioux don't fear the soul of the deceased, but rather reach out to spirits in times of need and communicate with them.
the Lakota do not have a fear of death or of going to an underworld. They do believe in a spirit world, Wakan Tanka, in the sky in which the deceased are free of pain and suffering.
moving from this world to the next is not something to be mourned, but rather it is something to be celebrated.
The deceased's corpse is universally considered sacred, but burial and memorial customs for after death are specific to tribes. Practices are different based on location too.
Cremation: Burning the deceased helps them enter the afterlife. The smoke sends the body upward in their journey. This was custom to many tribes, including the Odawa.
Mortuary Pole: This is an uncommon type of totem pole, sometimes used by the Haida and Tlingit for important members of tribe to keep the ashes of tribe members after cremation. 
The ashes or body of the person who has died is placed within the pole, making a very prominent memorial.
Tree burial: The Sioux, Ute, and Navajo tribes used platforms like a scaffold or tree to bring the deceased closer to the sky. 
Animals consume the body bringing the life cycle full circle, similar to a Tibetan Sky burial.
Earth Burial: Sioux Native Americans view the earth as our Mother, and when a family member dies, a dirt burial is the best way to reconnect with the planet and free the soul.
# Aboriginies
Sorry Business is a broad-scope term that indicates a valuable time for mourning and where Indigenous people will come together to attend funerals, events, ceremonies, and activities.
Rather than holding one funeral and a wake or celebration of life immediately after, as is the norm in Western cultures, Aboriginal people often observe several events over a week or more, where kinship beliefs mean that many more people will be welcome and obligated to attend
It is essential to reiterate that Aboriginal groups, tribes, and communities have diverse beliefs, and their approach to death and the afterlife may differ.
Many Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, for example, believe that they should not speak the name of the person who has passed away.
Speaking their name or showing a photograph may be thought to disturb the spirit and prevent it from leaving safely.
Families may remain at home for some time following the death of a loved one, followed by cleansing ceremonies.
These long-established traditions assist the spirit, help loved ones cope with a loss, and send a person safely onto the next part of their journey.
A person with a kinship relationship with the deceased person may feel a strong obligation and responsibility to participate in Sorry Business.
Their role within a memorial ceremony or funeral may also depend on the kinship system.
It is vital for workforces and other parties to recognise that Sorry Business is not optional or a singular event that an individual can choose whether to attend.
Most funerals involve extended communities, where people unite in mourning and provide support for one another. 
Some may feel unable to attend any other meeting or event while Sorry Business continues, a belief upheld by many First Nations people and respected by organisations and councils within the area.
many Indigenous people believe that when we leave this world, we enter the Land of the Dead.
The Land of the Dead does not have a heaven or hell, nor is admittance dependent on how a person lived.
The Eternal Dreaming is a worldview, which is the way many Aboriginal people perceive the relationship between the spirit, our physical environment, and our earthly bodies.
Death may be sad for loved ones and communities, but it does not mean a spirit ceases to exist. 
With the right care and respect, the spirit can continue an ongoing cycle of life, death, transition, and rebirth.
# Tibetan
For a Tibetan Buddhist, death changes - or at least can change - everything.
The importance of rebirth is a major influence on how Tibetan Buddhists approach dying and death and how they conduct the funerary rituals for a deceased loved one.
In Tibetan Buddhist belief, rebirth is central to the entire structure of existence.
Death is the bridge between lives. It's the end of one life, but at the same time it's also the necessary prelude to rebirth in a new life, which will end in death - and so on, across a vast expanse of time.
the death-rebirth cycle ending only when enlightenment is attained.
is it inevitable that a person will be reborn in human form? there are six realms of existence.
one's next life may be as a god or titan, an animal, a hungry ghost, or an inhabitant of the terrible hell realms.
There are many regional variations in the performance of these rites.
The moment of death itself is an opportunity to attain enlightenment. 
It is believed that as the dying person finally relinquishes this life, he will for a moment see a clear white light. 
If the person is able to recognize this light - that it reveals the true nature of reality - he will immediately become enlightened and escape from the round of samsaric rebirths.
Every effort is made to ensure that the dying person is peaceful and undisturbed. 
The person is surrounded with reminders of any religious teachings they have received and is gently urged to settle their earthly affairs so they won't be distracted from focusing on the Buddha's teachings as they move into the bardo.
As soon as possible after death, a religious professional - a monk, a lama, or a yogin - will perform powa, a ritual that seeks to expel the deceased's consciousness from the body through the top of the head.
Powa sends it directly to a buddha's pure land, where it will reach enlightenment without any further samsaric rebirths.
It is as if the survivors, while hoping for the best, also make provision for the worst-case scenario.
their activities will primarily be directed toward promoting the spiritual well-being of the deceased in the new life.
They will also seek to protect themselves from any supernatural harm arising from the death, in particular some hostile manifestation of the deceased.
These activities will continue up to and beyond the disposal of the body.
If the deceased didn't attain either enlightenment at the moment of death or rebirth through the powa ritual, the next-best result would be for the person to obtain a fortunate rebirth as a human being who has the opportunity to practice the Buddha's teachings.
the deceased must die focused on the Dharma, and this is another reason that so much emphasis is placed on ensuring that the dying person is kept undisturbed, reminding him of any teachings he may have received, and surrounding him with holy articles and prayers.
Second, the deceased must be helped to navigate the bardo period in such a way that the conditions for his next birth will be optimal.
The role of guide through the bardo is performed by a religious professional.
A wide variety of texts are used. The so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead, familiar to Western Buddhists, is only one of very many.
they all contain the basic elements of informing the deceased that she is dead and instructing her on the phenomena she can expect to encounter in the bardo, and advising her on how to react.
At every step along the way, she is urged to recognize the true nature of reality, which will take her to enlightenment.
it's recognized that the longer the deceased remains in the bardo state, the more likely she is to be reborn in one of the samsaric realms.
it's still hoped that she will be able - even by such a small thing as recalling a fragment of the Dharma she heard in her last life - to improve her chance of finding a new life in which she'll be able to make more spiritual progress.
Another important mechanism for ensuring that the deceased will obtain a fortunate rebirth is for the survivors to perform meritorious acts and dedicate the merit arising from them to the benefit of the dead person.
This is a major activity of the survivors, since it's accessible to all without the assistance of a religious professional.
It is vitally important to perform all the funeral rituals properly, because otherwise the deceased may be unhappy.
This will hinder his passage through the bardo, since he will be drawn by his distress to stay attached to the people who have upset him. It will also mean that the survivors will have a restless ghost on their hands who may cause all kinds of havoc.
The fear of ghosts is very real, and every effort is made to ensure that the deceased has no reason to be discontented with how his passing was handled by the survivors.
In addition to carefully following the directives of the death horoscope, the relatives of the deceased will 'feed' them until the funeral rituals are completed. This feeding consists of offering various foodstuffs, often by burning them.
The smoke arising from the burned food is believed to nourish the being the deceased has become in the intermediate (bardo) state.
In addition, a portion of the food may be offered to the hungry ghosts who are believed to be everywhere: often they are dead people who have been forgotten, or left unprovided for, by their survivors.
to ensure the spiritual well-being of the deceased, one of the most important is to ensure that the mortuary rituals are properly performed - and in particular that the body is disposed of in an appropriate manner.
The death horoscope will indicate the best form of disposal, as well as the proper day and time, and may also provide information on who should carry the body, where it should be disposed of, and what the deceased's prospects for rebirth are.
If the forecast for the person's rebirth is not auspicious, this will call for remedial steps, which may include such meritorious actions as commissioning the painting of a holy picture, copying a religious text, or paying religious professionals to perform rituals.
the gift of one's body to feed other beings is regarded as highly virtuous.
In exposure, the body is consumed by scavengers, including birds, wolves, foxes, dogs, and even pigs. By feeding these animals with their body, the deceased is saving them from the bad karma of having to kill other animals in order to eat.
In water, the body nourishes fish, and in earth disposal (either in a grave or under a cairn), it provides food for worms.
In cremation, as in feeding the dead, the smoke from the burning body is believed to provide nourishment to hungry ghosts and thereby to ease their suffering.
Following the disposal of the body, the deceased will continue to receive 'feeding' and guidance through the bardo until the completion of the funeral period.
Another important activity at this time is purifying the karma of the dead person. The person's name is written on a card, and her consciousness is summoned into it, then various purification rituals are conducted to free her from negative karma accumulated in her life or more-distant past lives.
At the conclusion of the rite, the deceased's consciousness is dismissed and the name card is burned. The ashes may be made into a small clay figure called a tsatsa, which will be placed in some location of special holiness or purity.
A common merit-making activity following a death is to distribute food to everyone in the village.
whatever the extent of the meal, the most important element is its impartiality. Every single person in the village, irrespective of age, gender, or social standing, must be invited, and each must receive the same quantity of food.
they may simply brew up a batch of chang (beer), go to the edge of the village, and give some to anyone who passes until it's all gone.
The rituals are expensive both monetarily and in lost work time, and only very wealthy families can afford seven weeks of expenditure.
the formal teaching is that the deceased may remain in the bardo for up to forty-nine days, in practice the rituals are rarely continued for so long.
Tibetans are taught early on to meditate on the brevity of life and the certainty of death and are warned to live in such a way as to be ready to die at any time.
often a layperson's mortuary rites will conclude just a few days after disposal, with a final round of merit making and purification rituals.
The most feared death is the unexpected death - by accident or violence - since a person who is not prepared to enter the bardo is unlikely to succeed in finding a fortunate rebirth.
the effect of Tibetan Buddhist belief in the cycle of rebirth also extends beyond any psychological effect of helping the survivors cope with the fact of loss to having an impact on some very practical aspects of Tibetan life.
having more religious professionals generates more merit. But they come at a high cost: they must be housed and fed for the duration of the ceremonies and provided with all the necessary materials for preparing ritual items.
Commissioning the painting of thangkas and the copying of religious texts is also expensive. In fact, such activities, which must be carried out by religious professionals, can form a significant element of monastic income.
It is generally accepted that the more money that is spent, the more meritorious the death rituals are, and therefore the more beneficial for the future state of the deceased.
to avoid the possibility of the deceased's returning as an unhappy ghost to protest any perceived inadequacy in the activities of the survivors - it is quite usual for families to go deeply into debt in order to defray the costs of a suitably meritorious funeral.
Moreover, friends and fellow villagers are expected to contribute to the well-being of the deceased's family at this time by providing gifts of money and food, thereby setting up a system of reciprocal indebtedness within the village. 
In some cases these offerings may be formalized in the shape of a ledger of entries indicating exactly what has been donated by whom in the case of each death.
The economics of death are complex and deeply woven into Tibetan society, reinforcing the social cohesion engendered by the shared belief in rebirth that is foundational to the practice of Tibetan Buddhism.
# Green Burial
Given that green burial hasn't seen much light of day in a century or so in the US, it stands to reason that statistical information might be fairly hard to come by.
Apparently the same people who tout the practice of going as naturally as possible to the grave are also science and math geeks.
On average, a cemetery buries 1,000 gallons of embalming fluid, 97.5 tons of steel, 2,028 tons of concrete, and 56,250 board feet of high quality tropical hardwood in just one acre of land.
Each cremation releases between .8 and 5.9 grams of mercury as bodies are burned. This amounts to between 1,000 and 7,800 pounds of mercury released each year in the U.S. 75% goes into the air and the rest settles into the ground and water.
You could drive about 4,800 miles on the energy equivalent of the energy used to cremate someone.
With 195 countries in the world, only the US and Canada embalm routinely.
The rest of the world has apparently been burying without embalming or using vaults since time began and has continued to do so for millennia without adverse effects, including ferociously hungry animals without enough to keep them fed above ground.
In 1998, there was one intentional green cemetery in the US. There are now more than 300.
More and more United States residents wish to be buried in only a shroud without embalming fluid.
They want to be prepared for the call that they know will ultimately be coming.
Green burial is the simplest, most natural way to return a body to the Earth after death.
It's a return to practices that have been in use for thousands of years. 
Only in the last 100 years or so have embalming and the use of concrete vaults in cemeteries become the norm.
Green burial is a way to leave a legacy that feeds the planet and doesn't create any pollution or waste.
Green burials need only to be dug to a depth of 3.5 feet. Groundwater is found at depths far deeper than this - anywhere from 50 to 75 feet below the surface. The soil itself acts as a natural filter.
natural burials are deep enough to create a smell barrier. If the animals can’t smell the bodies, then neither can we.
A conservation burial ground is one that combines the services of a natural burial ground with the added bonus of land conservation on a larger scale through the participation of an established conservation organization.
The reuse of plots is possible, though the practice is not as common in the US as it is in other countries.
In some green cemeteries, graves are marked with a natural stone that lays flat on the ground and is painted or engraved with the deceased's information. 
Some green cemeteries do not allow grave markers, but have a central wall or memorial where the names of all the people buried there are engraved.
The price of green burial is typically less expensive than modern burial. 
most people will use the services of a funeral director to assist with the transportation and refrigeration of the body after death, and to file the death certificate and other paperwork.
The cost of these services can be significant but vary from funeral home to funeral home.
every cemetery has its own prices for plots and interment fees and prices vary there as well depending on where the cemetery is located and what kind of a cemetery it is.
# Judaism
In Judaism, life is valued above almost all else.
The Talmud notes that, since all mankind is descended from a single person, taking a life is like destroying an entire world while saving a life is like saving an entire world.
Death, however, is not viewed as a tragedy, even when it occurs early in life or through unfortunate circumstances.
Death, like life, has meaning and is part of a divine plan. 
Jews have a firm belief in an afterlife where those who have lived a worthy life will be rewarded.
Where death is imminent and the patient is suffering, Jewish law does permit one to cease artificially prolonging life.
Mourning practices in Judaism are extensive, but they are not an expression of fear or distaste for death.
Jewish practices relating to death and mourning have two purposes: to show respect for the dead (kavod ha-met), and to comfort the living (nihum avelim), who will miss the deceased.
After a person dies, the eyes are closed, the body is laid on the floor and covered, and candles are lit next to the body.
The body is never left alone until after burial, as a sign of respect. 
The people who sit with the dead body are called shomerim, from the root Shin-Mem-Resh, meaning 'guards' or 'keepers'.
Respect for the dead body is a matter of paramount importance.
For example, the shomerim may not eat, drink, or perform a commandment in the presence of the dead. To do so would be considered mocking the dead, because the dead can no longer do these things.
Most communities have an organization to care for the dead, known as the chevra kaddisha (the holy society).
Their work is considered extremely meritorious, because they are performing a service for someone who can never repay them.
Autopsies in general are discouraged as desecration of the body. They are permitted, however, where it may save a life or where local law requires it. 
When autopsies must be performed, they should be minimally intrusive.
The presence of a dead body is considered a source of ritual impurity. For this reason, a Kohein may not be in the presence of a corpse.
People who have been in the presence of a body wash their hands before entering a home. This is to symbolically remove spiritual impurity, not physical uncleanness.
In preparation for the burial, the body is thoroughly cleaned and wrapped in a simple, plain linen shroud.
The Sages decreed that both the dress of the body and the coffin should be simple, so that a poor person would not receive less honor in death than a rich person.
In the case of men, the body is wrapped in a tallit with its tzitzit rendered invalid. The body is not embalmed, and no organs or fluids may be removed.
The body must not be cremated. It must be buried in the earth. 
Coffins are not required, but if they are used, they must have holes drilled in them so the body comes in contact with the earth.
The body is never displayed at funerals; open casket ceremonies are forbidden by Jewish law.
According to Jewish law, exposing a body is considered disrespectful, because it allows not only friends, but also enemies to view the dead, mocking their helpless state.
Jewish law requires that a tombstone be prepared, so that the deceased will not be forgotten and the grave will not be desecrated.
It is customary in some communities to keep the tombstone veiled, or to delay in putting it up, until the end of the 12-month mourning period. 
The idea underlying this custom is that the dead will not be forgotten when he is being mourned every day. 
In communities where this custom is observed, there is generally a formal unveiling ceremony when the tombstone is revealed.
The establishment of a separate place for the burial of Jews, although an ancient practice, is not mandated.
In Talmudic times, while ancestral tombs continued to be used, public burial plots were already established.
In one reference, the Talmud suggests that a righteous man cannot be buried next to a sinner, which would indicate that burying in communal cemeteries did take place.
During World War Two, the law committee of the Jewish Welfare Board’s Division of Religious Activities, consisting of all denominations of rabbis, ruled that Jewish chaplains may officiate at military services in national cemeteries.
Jewish mourning practices can be broken into several periods of decreasing intensity. 
These mourning periods allow the full expression of grief, while discouraging excesses of grief and allowing the mourner to gradually return to a normal life.
When a close relative first hears of the death of a relative, it is traditional to express the initial grief by tearing one's clothing.
The mourner recites the blessing describing God as 'the true Judge,' an acceptance of God's taking of the life of a relative.
From the time of death to the burial, the mourner's sole responsibility is caring for the deceased and preparing for the burial.
This period usually lasts a day or two; Judaism requires prompt burial.
During this aninut period, the family should be left alone and allowed the full expression of grief. Condolence calls or visits should not be made during this time.
After the burial, a close relative, near neighbor or friend prepares the first meal for the mourners.
The next period of mourning is known as shiva (seven, because it lasts seven days).
Shiva is observed by parents, children, spouses and siblings of the deceased, preferably all together in the deceased's home.
Shiva begins on the day of burial and continues until the morning of the seventh day after burial.
Mourners sit on low stools or the floor instead of chairs, do not wear leather shoes, do not shave or cut their hair, do not wear cosmetics, do not work, and do not do things for comfort or pleasure.
Mourners wear the clothes that they tore at the time of learning of the death or at the funeral. Mirrors in the house are covered. 
Prayer services are held where the shiva is held, with friends, neighbors, and relatives making up the minyan.
The Sabbath that occurs during the shiva period counts toward the seven days of shiva, but is not observed as a day of mourning.
The next period of mourning is known as shloshim (thirty, because it lasts until the 30th day after burial). During that period, the mourners do not attend parties or celebrations, do not shave or cut their hair, and do not listen to music.
The final period of formal mourning is avelut, which is observed only for a parent. This period lasts for twelve months after the burial. During that time, mourners avoid parties, celebrations, theater and concerts.
For eleven months of avelut, starting at the time of burial, traditionally the son of the deceased recites the mourner's Kaddish every day. Today, many daughters also recite the Kaddish.
After the avelut period is complete, the family of the deceased is not permitted to continue formal mourning.
Every year, on the anniversary of the death, family members observe the deceased's Yahrzeit.
Mourners light a candle in honor of the decedent that burns for 24 hours.
When visiting a mourner, a guest should not try to express grief with standard, shallow platitudes. The guest should allow the mourner to initiate conversations.
One should not divert the conversation from talking about the deceased; to do so would limit the mourner’s ability to fully express grief, which is the purpose of the mourning period.
The caller should encourage conversation about the deceased.
When leaving a house of mourning, it is traditional for the guest to say, 'May the Lord comfort you with all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.'
Kaddish is commonly known as a mourner's prayer, but in fact, variations on the Kaddish prayer are routinely recited at many other times, and the prayer itself has nothing to do with death or mourning.
The real mourner's prayer is El Molai Rachamim, which is recited at grave sites and during funerals.
After a great loss like the death of a parent, you might expect a person to lose faith in God, or to cry out against God's injustice.
Instead, Judaism requires a mourner to stand up every day, publicly and reaffirm faith in God despite this loss. To do so inures to the merit of the deceased in the eyes of God, because the deceased must have been a very good parent to raise a child who could express such faith in the face of personal loss.
According to Jewish tradition, the soul must spend some time purifying itself before it can enter heaven. The maximum time required for purification is 12 months for the evilest person.
It is also customary in some communities to place small stones on a gravesite when visiting it.
It seems to have superstitious origins. 
It's a little like leaving a calling card for the dead person, to let them know you were there.
may her soul be bound in the bond of eternal life.
You may also find Jewish symbols on a tombstone, such as a menorah, a Magen David, a Torah scroll, a lion, or the two tablets of the Ten Commandments.
# Murder
It has just happened that I have found myself in the vicinity of murder rather more often than would seem normal.
Free mankind from the tyranny of death.
One does not talk about murder. One does not discuss these things.
Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend.
Murder is, after all, a very personal crime.
One shouldn't go so near to a garden of death, and then complain of lonely path to travel.
A lot of these young men have no idea of the cost of murder.
There is something rather comforting about dying violently in a thunderstorm.
I think, my dear, we won't talk any more about murder during tea. Such an unpleasant subject.
How can you and I set about preventing a murder?
